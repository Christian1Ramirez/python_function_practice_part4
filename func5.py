# # Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.
# The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print
# Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. Each number is the two numbers above it added together.
